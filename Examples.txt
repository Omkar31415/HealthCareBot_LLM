Example 1: Respiratory Symptoms
I've had a persistent dry cough for about 2 weeks now. It gets worse at night and early morning. I also have a mild fever (around 99.5Â°F) and feel fatigued throughout the day. Recently, I've noticed some shortness of breath when climbing stairs. No chest pain, but I feel a tightness sometimes when breathing deeply. No previous respiratory conditions.

Example 2: Digestive Issues
For the past 5 days, I've experienced severe abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant. The pain is sharp and worsens after eating. I've had nausea and vomited twice yesterday. No diarrhea, but haven't had a bowel movement in 3 days. No blood in vomit. Lost appetite completely. No fever. History of IBS but this feels different and more intense.

Example 3: Headache/Neurological
I've been experiencing intense headaches for the past week, mainly on the right side of my head. The pain is throbbing and sometimes feels like pressure behind my right eye. Light sensitivity and occasional nausea accompany the headaches. They last about 4-6 hours and over-the-counter pain medication barely helps. I've also noticed some blurred vision in my right eye just before the headaches start. No history of migraines, but my mother has them.

Example 4: Joint Pain
My knee joints, especially the right one, have been increasingly painful over the last 3 months. The pain is worse in the morning with stiffness that lasts about an hour after waking up. There's some swelling, and the area feels warm to touch. Walking up and down stairs is becoming difficult. I'm 52 years old and have worked in construction most of my life. No recent injuries, but I was diagnosed with mild hypertension last year and take lisinopril daily.

Example 5: Skin Condition
I've developed a red, itchy rash on my hands and wrists that started about 10 days ago. The rash has small bumps that sometimes weep clear fluid when scratched. The itching gets worse at night and the affected areas are now starting to show some scaling and cracking. I recently started using a new dish soap, but otherwise no changes to my routine or diet. No known allergies and I haven't taken any new medications.

Example 6: Combination of Symptoms (More Complex)
'm experiencing three main issues that might be related: extreme fatigue even after 9 hours of sleep, unexplained weight loss (about 15 pounds in the last 2 months without trying), and frequent urination, including getting up 3-4 times at night. I'm constantly thirsty, and my mouth feels dry most of the time. I've also noticed that small cuts seem to take longer to heal than usual. I'm 47 years old with a family history of diabetes, but I've never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. My job is sedentary, and I admit my diet has included a lot of processed foods lately.


# Mental Health
I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately with work and my personal life. I can't seem to get a handle on things.

I don't see the point in anything anymore. I'm so tired all the time and nothing brings me joy.

I'm actually doing better today than last week. I still feel anxious about my presentation tomorrow, but I'm managing it better than I used to.

I'm sad and I don't know what I'll do anymore. my dog just died
